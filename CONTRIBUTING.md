# Contributing Guidelines

Welcome to the world of collaboration! We appreciate your interest in contributing to Kubernetes Manifests for ARM64. Together, we can unlock the true potential of Kubernetes on ARM64 architecture. ðŸš€

We believe that collaboration fuels innovation and we value every contribution. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, your ideas, suggestions, and improvements are highly encouraged.

To ensure a smooth and collaborative experience, please follow these guidelines when contributing to this project:

## Getting Started

1. Fork the Repository: Start by creating your own fork of the [Kubernetes Manifests for ARM64 repository](https://github.com/SeanRiggs/kubernetes-manifests-arm64/fork).

2. Clone the Repository: Clone your forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/kubernetes-manifests-arm64.git


3. Create a Branch: Create a new branch to work on your contributions. Choose a descriptive and meaningful branch name that reflects the nature of your changes.

4. Make Changes: Implement your changes, improvements, or additions to the Kubernetes manifests, ensuring they are optimized for ARM64 architecture.

5. Test Your Changes: Before submitting your contribution, make sure to test your changes thoroughly on an ARM64-based Kubernetes cluster. Ensure that everything works as expected and there are no conflicts or issues.

6. Commit and Push: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit your changes and push them to your forked repository:

git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin your-branch-name


7. Create a Pull Request: Head over to the [original repository](https://github.com/SeanRiggs/kubernetes-manifests-arm64) and create a new Pull Request. Provide a clear and descriptive title and description for your Pull Request, outlining the purpose and scope of your changes.

8. Collaboration and Review: Engage in discussions and collaborate with other contributors and maintainers. Be open to feedback and suggestions to improve your contributions. Our goal is to create the best Kubernetes manifests for ARM64 together.

9. Continuous Integration and Deployment: Once your Pull Request is approved and merged, our continuous integration (CI) pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy the changes to ensure the stability and reliability of the Kubernetes manifests.
