Welcome to the extraordinary world of Kubernetes Manifests for ARM64! ðŸš€

This repository houses an impressive collection of mind-blowing Kubernetes manifests specially designed to unleash the full potential of your ARM64 infrastructure. Experience seamless deployments, scalable configurations, and unparalleled reliability like never before.

## Infrastructure Details

These manifests have been meticulously built, deployed, and tested on the following infrastructure (adjust as needed):

- 4-node Proxmox cluster consisting of ARM64 Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 8GB devices.
- 5-node high-availability Kubernetes k3s cluster. The cluster is built on 5 different virtual machines running Ubuntu Cloud Image (Jammy 22.04), leveraging etcd, KubeVIP, and MetalLB.
- The cluster was deployed using Ansible, following Techno Tim's deployment method as demonstrated in this YouTube video: [Kubernetes Deployment by Techno Tim](https://youtu.be/CbkEWcUZ7zM).
- Additionally, an NFS share is utilized, which is deployed on a separate Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB running OMV (OpenMediaVault) with a 1TB USB hard drive.

Please note that at this time, we are not utilizing any storage solution other than local PV (persistent volume). Although Longhorn was initially tested, it proved to be too resource-intensive for a Pi Proxmox cluster and would crash without extensive fine-tuning.

For those interested in Rancher, you can explore Techno Tim's deployment or refer to Network Chuck's video guide on how to set it up. Stay tuned for my upcoming comprehensive setup blog, where I will provide detailed insights into my entire configuration.
